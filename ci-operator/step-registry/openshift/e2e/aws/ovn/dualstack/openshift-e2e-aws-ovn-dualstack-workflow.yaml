    The Openshift E2E AWS OVN workflow executes the common end-to-end test suite in AWS
    with the OVNKubernetes network plugin with dual-stack networking configured.

    This workflow validates dual-stack networking support (IPv4 + IPv6) for AWS installations.
    The test configures both IPv4 and IPv6 network stacks and validates that the cluster
    functions properly with both IP families.
